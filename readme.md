# Deadsniper

Dead link (broken link) means a web page you have previously linked to is no longer available.
These dead links have a negative impact on SEO, Security and user experience.
This tool, inspired by [DeadFinder](https://github.com/hahwul/deadfinder), makes it easy to hunt them down.

Note that this tool is much more limited in scope, only allowing use with a sitemap and only checking https links.
For customization and a slower, but broader tool, use [DeadFinder](https://github.com/hahwul/deadfinder).

## Usage

```
deadsniper <link to sitemap.xml>
```

For example

```
deadsniper https://port19.xyz/sitemap.xml
```
